# 26th November - TechKaro (React)

### What did we study today?
We studied:
- Automated Unit Tests of JS code
- Used CreateReactApp scaffold to practice writing unit tests on simple JS functions
- Test-Driven Development and its benefits

NOTE: The code attached in this folder is meant to run inside the CreateReactApp (CRT) scaffold project, because it would otherwise require manually setting up Karma / Mocha etc. CRT has that setup already, so you can start testing right away!
