### What did we study today?
We studied the following topics:
- [constructor function shortcut syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS)
- constructor naming conventions:
  - TitleCase
  - Noun
- Object `properties` (data) and `methods` (action)
- Object prototype
- [Prototype chain](https://dev.to/codesmith_staff/explain-javascripts-prototype-chain-like-im-five-51p)

We also looked at
- Photoshop random stuff like changing color and opacity. Selecting objects and moving them around. Changing backgrounds, etc. (see how we changed [this image](image3.jpg) to [this using Photoshop](background.png))
- RAM vs HardDisk for storage (Kitchen Salad example - bench vs fridge)

### Homework
- Complete FreeCodeCamp Javascript Object Oriented Programming tasks
