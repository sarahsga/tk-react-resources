# 5th September - TechKaro (React)

### What did we study today?
We studied the following topics:
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - How to download and install Github Desktop
  - Sign In to Github Desktop with your Github Website username and password
  - How to **clone** a repo
  - How to **create a new repo** on your computer
  - How to **publish** your repo to Github Website
  - How to **push your changes** from your computer to Github Website
  - How to **pull remote changes** from Github Website to your computer
  - How to **view green/red highlights** before committing
  - How to **commit** your changes before pushing
  - How to view History of commits on Github Desktop
- How to **ignore** files and folders using [.gitignore](.gitignore) file (We usually put auto-generated folders like node_modules inside the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file)
- The `dependencies` item inside [package.json](https://github.com/sarahsga/tk-react-resources/blob/4b765bc1b2fe725c23c5f9b3a227ecd1771ed0e6/2019-09-05/package.json#L11)
  - It lists all the npm package names that should be inside node_modules in order for the project to start/run successfully
- How to install all project `dependencies` using a single npm command
```
npm install
```
The above command checks `dependencies` inside [package.json](https://github.com/sarahsga/tk-react-resources/blob/4b765bc1b2fe725c23c5f9b3a227ecd1771ed0e6/2019-09-05/package.json#L11) and installs all packages inside the node_modules folder automatically.
