# 17th August - TechKaro (React)

### What did we study today?
We studied the following topics:
- What is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl)?
- What is EcmaScript?
- What is [ES6](https://webapplog.com/es6/)?
- Anonymous functions
- [Arrow Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp)
- What are Callback functions?
- [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Timeouts_and_intervals#setTimeout())
- [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Timeouts_and_intervals#setInterval())

### Homework
- Create a Stopwatch using JS
- Create a Timer using JS

### Some Notes:

- Javascript is also called EcmaScript
- Some browsers (like Internet Explorer) do not support latest JS versions. So we use Babel to convert latest JS syntax into legacy syntax.
- `let`, `const`, `string backticks` and `arrow functions` are all ES6 features
- Arrow functions are a shortform of anonymous functions, because programmers are lazy and they like to use short forms a lot.
- Anonymous function: A function that has no name.
- Callback function: A function that is passed as an input to another function. 
- Urdu definition of Callback: Woh input jis ki data type function ho, usay Callback function kehtay hain.
