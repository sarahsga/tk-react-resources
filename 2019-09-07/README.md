# 7th September - TechKaro (React)

### What did we study today?
We studied the following topics:
- [Bootstrap in a simple HTML / CSS / JS ](https://getbootstrap.com/) Website
- [Bootstrap in a React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) website


### Notes
- Bootstrap is a ready-made CSS file. You have ready-made classes and you can use them to quickly add CSS to your website
- To use Bootstrap in a simple HTML / CSS / JS page, just link the [Bootstrap CDN](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) in your HTML file before your custom style.css
- To [use Bootstrap in a React app](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction), use npm
```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```
and then import the component that you want to use inside your `.js` or `.jsx` files
